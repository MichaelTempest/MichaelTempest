- 👋  Hi, I’m @MichaelTempest
- 👀  I’m interested in interesting new tools and concepts, but also patterns and practises that make code easier to read and support 
- 🌱  I’m currently learning to be an engineering manager, and also Go (along with firming up my exisiting knowledge in other languages)
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help expand my knowledge, and is a genuinely interesting project
